Capybara.add_selector(:rich_text_field, locator_type: [String, Symbol]) do
  label "rich text field (CKEditor)"

  xpath do |locator, **_options|
    xpath = XPath.descendant(:"opce-ckeditor-augmented-textarea")
    next xpath if locator.nil?

    # All the complexity is caused by the need to have the textarea id be a json
    # string (to be parsed by populateInputsFromDataset), so following would not
    # work due concat function unlike = operator using only first node in the
    # node set, so doesn't work if there are multiple labels with text "foo":
    #
    # .//opce-ckeditor-augmented-textarea[
    #   ./@data-text-area-id = concat('"', //label[contains(text(), 'foo')]/@for, '"')
    # ]
    #
    # Alternatively we could construct more complicated xpath that would search
    # for opce tag that has textarea id matching attribute of label that matches
    # opce tag textarea id, but that double matching looks worse than more
    # complicated search:
    #
    # .//opce-ckeditor-augmented-textarea[
    #   ./@data-text-area-id = concat('"', //label[
    #     contains(text(), 'foo') and
    #     concat('"', ./@for, '"') = //opce-ckeditor-augmented-textarea/@data-text-area-id
    #   ]/@for, '"')
