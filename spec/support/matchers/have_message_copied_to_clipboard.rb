# It's actually a bit random to test if the URL was actuall copied to the
# clipboard, because copying to clipboard may not work with headless browsers,
# probably due to missing clipboard permissions of the headless browser.

# Tried following without success
# https://copyprogramming.com/howto/emulating-a-clipboard-copy-paste-with-selinum-capybara
#
# Approach here is to account for that and expect either the copy successful
# message or the fallback message when copying is not possible.
#
# This is not 100% deterministic, but it's the best we can do for now.
