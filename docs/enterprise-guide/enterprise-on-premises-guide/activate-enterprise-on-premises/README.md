If you do not yet have a token, you can either [order an Enterprise on-premises token](#order-the-enterprise-on-premises-edition) or [request a trial token](../enterprise-on-premises-trial).

Once the token is saved successfully, your **Enterprise on-premises edition is activated** and the Enterprise add-ons become available immediately.

## Order the Enterprise on-premises edition

To **upgrade to the Enterprise on-premises edition**, click the **Upgrade now** button displayed on the Enterprise edition page. Alternatively, you can [request a trial token](../enterprise-on-premises-trial) to evaluate the Enterprise add-ons before purchasing.
