There are several ways of adding or linking files to work packages in OpenProject. You can manually attach files directly to work packages or use one of the integrations with file management systems.

## Manual upload

For the manual upload please refer to documentation on [attaching files to work packages](../work-packages/create-work-package/#add-attachments-to-work-packages).

## Nextcloud integration

You can use Nextcloud as an integrated file storage in OpenProject, allowing you to link files and folders stored in Nextcloud directly with work packages in OpenProject.

Please refer to [Nextcloud integration user guide](./nextcloud-integration) for further instructions on using the integration.

For the initial setup please refer to the [Nextcloud integration setup guide](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/nextcloud/).
