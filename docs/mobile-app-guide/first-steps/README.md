Follow these steps to install and start using the **OpenProject Mobile App (Beta)**:

## Check the Requirements

Before downloading the app, please ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

*   **An active OpenProject account:** Either from an **OpenProject Cloud** workspace or an **OpenProject On-premises** installation with API access enabled.
*   A **signed certificate** (**https** not http) on your instance to be able to log in.
*   **Minimum OpenProject version:** 17.0.0
> [!NOTE]
> If you have a previous version of OpenProject you can connect your OpenProject instance by asking your administrator to enable the Built in OAuth applications flag under `_{BASE_URL}/admin/settings/experimental_`.        
*   **Minimum system requirements:**
    *   **iOS 15** or later
    *   **Android 12** or later
*   **Built-in OAuth applications enabled:** Make sure that the built-in OAuth applications are **enabled in your administration settings** (`{BASE_URL}/admin/oauth/applications`). This is required for successful login from the mobile app.
