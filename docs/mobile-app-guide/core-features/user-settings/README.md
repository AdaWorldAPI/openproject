# User settings

The **User Settings** module allows users to personalize their mobile app experience, configure notifications, manage account details, and provide feedback. All settings are accessible through the user avatar, giving a central location for managing preferences and account-specific options.

## Personalization

You can customize how the app behaves and appears to suit their workflow and preferences. The following options are available:
*   **Change Launch Page**: You can select which page the app opens to by default when launched. Once the new launch page is set, closing and reopening the app will open directly on the selected page.
*   **Enabled Features:** Allows you to enable or disable specific features for a streamlined experience. This enables you to focus only on the tools relevant to their workflow.
*   **Change Language**: You can select their preferred language, which updates all app labels, menus, and interface elements accordingly.
*   **Switch Color Mode**: The app supports different color modes. You can switch between light, dark, or system-default modes to match your personal preference or device settings.

## Account and Personal Details

You can manage their personal information from the **Account Details** section. Changes to the name, email, or other personal data are reflected across both the mobile app and desktop/web interface, ensuring consistency across all OpenProject platforms.

## Notifications

The Notification Settings section allows you to configure how and when they receive notifications:
*   **Deactivate Local Notifications**: You can disable OS-level local pull notifications, preventing alerts from appearing on their device.
*   **Adjust Notification Preferences**: You can fine-tune which notifications they receive, such as participation alerts, non-participation alerts, or date-related reminders. Changes are applied to both mobile and desktop apps, and notifications will adhere to the new settings.

## Feedback

The app includes a **Feedback** section where you can provide suggestions, report issues, or share their experiences. Submitted feedback is sent to the OpenProject Mobile app team for review.
